    WHERE :
      a == slope (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope)
          * In mathematics, the "slope" or "gradient" of a line is a number that describes both the 'direction' and the 'steepness' of the line
          * Slope is calculated by finding the ratio of the "vertical change" to the "horizontal change" between (any) two distinct points on a line
                ** p1 (1,4), p2 (3,7) ==> (7-4) / (3-1) == 1.5 (this is the slope)
          * The 'steepness', incline, or grade of a line is measured by the absolute value of the slope. 
            A slope with a greater absolute value indicates a steeper line.
          * The direction of a line is either increasing, decreasing, horizontal or vertical. 
                ** A line is increasing if it goes up from left to right. The slope is positive, i.e. m > 0
                ** A line is decreasing if it goes down from left to right. The slope is negative, i.e. m < 0
                ** If a line is horizontal the slope is zero. This is a constant function.
                ** If a line is vertical the slope is undefined (see below).
      b == y-intercept
          * the y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y coordinate
      x,y == are holding the place of coordinates (x,y) of any point that lies on the line (they stay as a variables)

     Once we get the equation of a straight line from 2 points in space in y = mx + b format, we can use the same equation to predict 
     the points at different values of x which result in a straight line.
     
     In linear regression fashion : x is predictor column while y is the outcome (what we want to predict).
     So given that slope is 6 and the intercept is 2 we are goint to predict for :
        x = 1 => 8 (y = ax + b OR y = 6*1 + 2)
        x = 2 => 14 (y = 6*2 + 2)
        x = 10 => 62
